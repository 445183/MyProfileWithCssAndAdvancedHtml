       <h2>About Me -</h2>
       <p>Hello everyone , I love coding especially arduino and game programming , each time I write code or sketches I feel relaxed and cool minded as if I am in heaven making new games and robotics projects using arduino is what I like the most and each time I do something new I get a feel of immense joy and satisfaction . I also run my youtube channel in which I share my arduino projects and games I made till now on visual studio code , even this website is made using Visual Studio Code ! I am also planning to start coding on raspberry PI as well as its more faster and has many other features which arduino doesn't have , as I love arduino coding very much I am writing a book on how to code arduino to make hardware projects using coding .</p>

       <h2>What is arduino and how I mastered it -</h2>
       <p>First of all arduino is nothing but a programming platform where you can make mind blowing projects by coding it in C++ / C language , you can also add simple AI as well in these projects such as making a robot without sensor required such as digital watch without rtc module and soil moisture indicator without soil moisture sensor etc. however there is one limit that the code can't be too big / having too many variables as arduino board may get stuck and its irreversible change if once it gets stuck . When I had started using arduino I really didn't know how to code it and after doing more than 30 projects I tried to understand how the code exactly works . I slowly understood what exactly is arduino and how connections are introduced, they are classified as input / output etc. this is what taught me how to code arduino . I learnt arduino from experience you can too ! , You can join the arduino community and also see my arduino profile using link below , I will also be providing book's link which you can buy to learn arduino's concepts .</p>

       <h2>Game programming and me -</h2>
       <p>You might be thinking that I might have also learnt game programming from experience but that's not the case I learnt this from whitehat jr as its one of the best place from which I have learnt coding they teach game programming as if its our everyday playing and they make the concepts very easy for students like me to understand the concepts well not only to memorize them but to practically apply them wherever possible and each time I complete my classes and projects I feel truly exhilarating and joyful I have also created many games as well . I will also share link for playing the games , are you excited and also want learn coding languages such as javascript , html and block coding click on the link given below to book your free trial class from the referal link given by me if you join using the link by me you can get a lots of discount as well .</p>

       <h2>My youtube channel -</h2>
       <p>I always thought of making my own youtube channel like many youtubers , I thought that I like arduino the most so, I thought of making a youtube channel on that topic . It was really a very enjoyable moment when I made my first video and uploaded it on youtube , later on I thought of renovating my channel , I deleted all of my uploads and once again started my channel with more joy and excitement and that did the trick , previously I had only 7 subscribers but now I have more than 80 subscribers . If you are fan of robotics or arduino please visit my channel and subscribe it to get many cool and amazing projects .</p>
